Bioinformatics Scripts


This repository contains scripts used by the HEAT lab in analyzing genomic data and improving genome assemblies. 

###HEAT Tools

The bulk of the tools that we use are in the file `HEAT_Tools.py` in the `HEAT_Scripts` directory. This file can be imported as a module and used in scripts and interactive sessions. Nearly all of our tools rely on the `biopython` module for working with DNA sequence files.
